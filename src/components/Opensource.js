      Did you know that a large part of the software you use everyday was probably built with tools and technologies that are freely available for anyone to download, install, study, and modify?

      Software being open source means that not only is all of its source code available to download and view publicly, but its also available for anyone to modify and contribute back to. In fact, a lot of the success of open source software by definition is dependent on volunteers contributing changes and collaboratively making the software better.

Contributing to someone else codebase might seem like a daunting proposition, but all you really need is a computer connected to the internet and a desire to dive into the deep end of an interesting problem you want to contribute your time to.
